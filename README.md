This study evaluates a comprehensive general epidemic model [1] by applying it to three distinct disease outbreaks: the 2017 plague outbreak in Madagascar [2], a 2013 Norovirus outbreak in Jiangsu [3], and the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We evaluate that the general model captures the dynamics of these diverse diseases reasonably well, demonstrating its broad applicability despite omitting specific disease characteristics. However, challenges remain, particularly in the necessity of certain compartments and the reliance on extensive parameter calibration. These issues highlight the need for advanced fitting methods and new comparison metrics. Future research should focus on refining the model, developing protocols for practical application, and enhancing its adaptability to emerging diseases, ensuring it can effectively guide public health interventions. All code and data relevant for the model parameter fitting can be found in this repository.
